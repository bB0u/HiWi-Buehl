# HiWi-Buehl
Data Processing for KIT Hydrological Monitoring Network Buehl 

The Python Scripts in this repository aim to merge the data collected from several types of loggers.
Data collection usually takes place once a month and is conducted by a HiWi (research assistance).
The types of loggers and the individual loggers are listed here: 

## Rain gauges using OnSet HoBO event logger


## Soil Moisture using Campbell Scientific logger


## OTT Hydromet Pressure Transducer measuring the water level at a spring with Thomson weir (triangular weir)
