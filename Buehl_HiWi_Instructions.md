## What to bring to the Field Trip

### Own Stuff

- Water and Lunch
- Good shoes
- Mobile Phone (Download maps beforehead, not alway internet in the area. Maps.me is a good choice)
- Driving license ;)
- Long trousers (ticks!)
- Rain gear (umbrella) when rain is forecasted
- Stuff you picked up at KIT beforehand + key 

### From Uni

- Toughbook (charged)

- Folder with field protocols (there are also instructions for the different loggers in there)

- charged Pb car batteries for soil moisture

- Grey plastic box with:

  - All connection cables

  - Spare batteries, CR1032 for RainGauges, AA Lithium for Ott

  - Lubricant for rain gauge loggers because they tend to get stuck in connector

  - 10 mm open end wrench to disassemble rain gauge in case sth. is broken (often the Reed contact)

  - Small phillips screw driver to open rain gauge logger for battery replacement

  - Tape 

  - Cleaning stuff

  - shears for cutting stuff above rain gauges

    

## In the field

- First pick up Stadtmobil

- Get all the stuff from Uni

- Use google maps to navigate to the loggers, google maps gives slightly wrong direction for first site, follow the signs to "La Saletta" instead

- Fill out protocoll and download data at every site

- Replace batteries where necessary

- Clean clogged rain gauges

- Do not forget to launch the loggers again after download if necessary

- End of the day: Drive to uni, bring back stuff, depending on Stadtmobil station type you can already leave the Stadtmobil card when there is a key box, if you had to unlock the Stadtmobil with the card at the front window, you have to keep the card and bring it back to the secretary later 

- Downlaod data from Toughbook, maybe process it already (talk to Mirko)s
